Random Java files while working through a Java Udemy course

I'm currently working through the Tim Buchalka Java programming masterclass course. 
The files within are some scratch files while going through the course. The sorting algorithim and reversed array algorithim
used in ArrayChallenge and ReversedArray are just what I thought of off the top of my head, and not the optimal solution 
given by the course instructor afterwards.
